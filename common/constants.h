 * We encourage users to develop software with PCCTS.  However, we do ask

 * we mean that if you incorporate our source code into one of your
 * programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you

 * addition, we ask that this header remain intact in our source code.
 * As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing
 * this system and expect to make other tools available as they are
 * completed.
